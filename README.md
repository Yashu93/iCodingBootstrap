Welcome to the iCodingBootstrap wiki! This was created by YASH RAJ in the month of August 2021.

This is my story, YASH RAJ In the month of July, i saw an advertisement on my t.v. that to learn coding for creating apps,webpages and some programs, and that day changed my life. That day i knew that for making apps, you needed to do some stuffs know as "CODING"! I studied computer as much as I can, as I was in grade 6th, there was only about some basics of "C++" in my book. After that, I made a simple basic calculator(without any UI), and guess what if worked..!! I was crazily happy that day.. After this day, studied computer as much as I can, and here's a simple result that i made a website in just 1 week of work in the age of 12 only. Ahh!! Age doesn't matter for success. I also created a game in 1.5 week, using Unity... you can check that out, in the game development blog of website.

Now, HOW I CREATED THIS WEBSITE? I thought that to create a webpage for my journey or some blogs(or like, education related stuffs), and honestly at that time, I didn't knew how am i going to host this website.. And then, i searched many ways to host a source code file of a webpage on internet for FREE!! ahh yeah, this was a little stupidity. And yup I found this, GITHUB!! and hosted my source code file here..!!

And That's it for this Page... Work harder!!
